This is Marco’s *README*.

The purpose of this document is to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who have not worked with me before.

It’s also a way to build some trust by being open and vulnerable about who I am, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship.

# 🤖 About Me

My name is Marco, I live in the sunny city of Genova, in Italy, after spending several years in England and Scotland. I’m a huge fan of all kinds of sports, the main ones I practice are powerlifting, MTB, and snowboarding. I also like motorbikes, right now I have a Ducati Multistrada 1200S. I’m also an avid chess player and I’m always up for a game, you can find me on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/foldable).

# 📚 My Job

I’m the *Engineering Manager* for the Edge team.

My job is to ensure the *success* of the team, at two levels:

- success in terms of business objectives
- success in terms of personal growth and happiness

This means that it’s my responsibility to focus on the big picture, create alignment, and work with our Product team to define the roadmap for the team, ensuring that all roadblocks are removed. Equally important, it’s also my responsibility to maintain a psychologically safe environment, where every person in the team feels safe, happy, and motivated.

# 🎨 My Working Style

- I tend to ask “Why?” a lot
- I assume that you are very good at your job, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either trying to gather context, or be a rubber duck
- I believe in the [Servant Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) model, one of my main responsibilities is making sure that you are set up for success
- I highly value communication and prefer asynchronous, written communication over synchronous meetings
- Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me
- No agenda, no meeting

# 🙌 How you can help me

- Disagree with me and challenge my ideas, the best solutions are the product of a healthy level of debate
- Tell me when I screw up, if I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting context, please let me know about it
- Communicate a lot, provide an agenda to all meetings you invite me to
- Do amazing work

# 🎙️ Feedback

- If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something else entirely. Either way, please let me know about i
- If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to my manager so they can anonymously relay it to me
- Similarly, if you have feedback for a colleague, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's chat and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable

# ☕ 1:1s

- One-on-ones are *your time*. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc
- I encourage you to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help, since it can sometimes be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment
